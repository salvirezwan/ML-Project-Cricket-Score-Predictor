# Cricket Score Predictor

This is a Machine Learning Project that predicts the cricket score based on input parameters such as batting team, bowling team, city, current score, overs bowled, wickets out, and runs in the last 5 overs.

## Features

- Predicts the final score of a cricket match based on current match conditions.
- Uses Bootstrap for responsive design and styling.
- Validates user input to ensure meaningful predictions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (jQuery)
- Flask (for backend logic)
- Python (for prediction logic)
- Jupyter Notebook (for training the model)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-score-predictor.git
   cd cricket-score-predictor
   ```

2. Install required packages:
flask,
sci-kit learn,
pandas,
etc.

3. Run app.py
pipe = pickle.load(open('x.pkl', 'rb')) - Here, replace x with the name of the .pkl file which is generated by jupyter. 


## Customization
To add more teams or cities, update the dropdown options in the index.html file.
To change the default teams or city, modify the JavaScript logic in the index.html file to set the desired default values.
To adjust the prediction logic, update the backend logic in app.py.
